# DISTRI

**DISTRI** is a dedicated network simulator designed for multi-facility computational infrastructures. It focuses on the development and testing of algorithms that promote decentralization and resilience in multi-facility environments. This tool is particularly useful for researchers and developers who are looking to enhance the efficiency and robustness of multi-facility systems through advanced, decentralized solutions.

## Features

- **Simulation of Decentralized Algorithms**: Allows for the testing and benchmarking of decentralized computing algorithms within an multi-facility context.
- **Resilience Testing**: Evaluate the robustness of your multi-facility network against failures and dynamic network conditions.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Users can create diverse simulation environments to test different aspects of multi-facility network performance and algorithm efficiency.
- **Extensible Framework**: Designed to be modular, allowing users to easily add new algorithms and simulation parameters.
